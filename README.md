Professional Website for NM Technology. This is my PWP project for Deep Dive Coding.

## Milestone 2 Feedback
* Good content strategy, I like how well thought out it is.
* Wireframes do a good job of showing how you plan to design your site.
* The links to Milestone 1 and 2 that you have in the head need to be moved to the body. If you run your code through the W3C Validator it can help you figure out if you have errors and where they are.
* Try to commit more often, a good rule of thumb is every 15 minutes or 15 lines of code.

Overall good project, you have clearly thought out what the purpose of your site is and how you will present it on the page. Besides the misplacement of the hrefs, the code is clean and has no other errors. Nice work.
