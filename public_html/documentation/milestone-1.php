		commercial enterprises here in the State Of New Mexico.</p>

		<h2>Persona</h2>

		<h5>Name:</h5><p>Jennifer Jones</p>

		<h5>Business Name:</h5><p>Companion Cloud</p>

		<h5>Business Type:</h5><p>Companion Cloud provides pet cremation services for pet owners with deceased companions.
			They provide Urn products and other commemorative products to help with the loss of a pet that is equal to a
			family member.</p>

		<h5>Profession:</h5><p>Jennifer is the owner of Companion Cloud.</p>

		<h5>Technology:</h5><p>Jennifer uses a desktop computer during the day and an Apple laptop at night when she is at
			home browsing the internet. She also has an iPhone that she uses for phone and email communication.</p>

		<h5>Frustration's and Needs:</h5><p>Jennifer is near-sighted so she will benefit from a larger font format so she
			can read through my website with no issue. Jennifer doesn't like when she can't call and speak with a real
			person to find out information before she starts communicating through emails so she needs a direct contact
			number to the vendor on their website.</p>

		<h5>Goals:</h5><ul>
			<li>Jennifer needs to be able to find vendors using the internet that can help her power her business.</li>
			<li>Jennifer would like to use my website to gain a way to contact me from using my website's contact form.</li>
			<li>Jennifer is trying to find the best affordable price so she needs a way to compare affordability.</li>
		</ul>

		<h5>User Story:</h5><p>As a user of a vendors website I need to be able to browse through their site and see their
			accomplishments and business model to be able to determine a good fit. I also need to be able to contact them
			directly in order to ask them questions about my needs to see if their services are a good match for what I
			need.</p>
