	<h1>Concept Strategy for nmtis.com</h1>

	<h5>Welcome</h5><p>The welcoming index page of my website will have a top banner that is locked to the top of the
		page. The banner will include an image of the NM Technology & Integration Solutions and some more digital vector
		or ISO metric designs. The artwork will convey what our mission is all about which is providing solutions through
		modern technology. I will also include a brief mission statement that informs visitors what services we provide.
		Footer will be locked to bottom of page.</p>

	<h5>About Me</h5><p>The NM Technology website is geared toward providing local small businesses and
		commercial enterprises with solutions through technology here in the State Of New Mexico and beyond. We provide
		IP-CCTV installation, Commercial IT solutions, Web development and design! I have a small introduction on myself
		at my existing website and will migrate that text over to this new section.</p>

	<h5>Portfolio</h5><p>I would like to have an interactive display of images showing complete install and service work
		from previous jobs and this will overlay a background image of a network cabinet that will scroll with background
		when user scrolls down the page. This provides a visual to the website visitor what kind of work we can do for them.
		I also want to mention that we provide web and mobile application development. I want to list in text the languages
		I have started to learn here. Javascript, PhP, MySQL and front end development using HTML5 and SASS.</p>

	<h5>Contact</h5><p>I want to display the office phone number for NM Technology in the upper right corner but want to hide
		the contact number and create a function to reveal the phone number once the user clicks the cover/area. I also will
		include a contact form at the bottom of my website that has fields for first name, last name, email and message
		field then a submit button. Submit button will send the message to my email address at patrick@nmtis.com. I also
		will feature a current technology news section that lists tech current events to fill in some space and add content
		that attracts web traffic to the nmtis.com site.</p>
